         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 25<hi>th</hi> of this Inſtant <hi>Auguſt,</hi> will be expoſed to Sale, by Auction, a curious Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of painted <hi>Whores, Cracks, Night-Walkers, Newgate-Nappers, Bridewel-Workers, Ladies of Pleaſure, Cart-Dancers;</hi> with other ſuch diſſembling Pick-pocket Cheats, ſome Pox'd, ſome Clap'd, and ſome quite rotten and ready to fall in pieces: Some whereof will ſmile in your faces, and yet be ready, behind your backs, to cut your Throats for Sixpence. Others will chuck you under the Chin, with their Left-hands, and with their Right be picking your pockets. Some will be ſo drunk, when you carry them to the Tavern, that they will p—on your knees, and hug and kiſs you at ſo damnable a rate, that the ſtink of their breath will be ready to ſmother you, and force you to ſpew. Others will put one hand in your Cod-piece, and another in your Watch-pocket. Others will keep you in diſcourſe, till their Partners carry away your Hat, Cloak, Cane and Gloves Some will ſpew in your face, when you are buſy with them, whilſt you are already half ſtifled by the ſtink of their breath. Who can but buy and love ſuch pretty profitable, and well accompliſh'd Ladies? VVherein ſo many ſuch Qualities are concentered.</p>
            <p>There will be great variety both of VVhores and Tricks, more than I can well inform you of, at preſent. But for the ſatisfaction of the young Sparks, who yearly frequent the place, I give this account that followeth.</p>
